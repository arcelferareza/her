      <p>Hi Mayven,</p>

      <p>I just want you to know that I have a huge feeling for you, and I totally love you. I want to meet you in person. I mean it. You deserve to be loved and seen. I’m here to support and comfort you whenever you feel down.</p>
      <p>You're my Gwen Stacy, and I am your Spider-Man.</p>
      <p>You have a big potential to be my first girlfriend first and last.</p>
      <p>Please know that you are my path. And you are always going to be my path.</p>
      <p>We all have to make a choice, right? Well, I choose you.</p>
      <p>So here’s my thought. I’m following you now. I’m just going to follow you everywhere. I’m just going to follow you for the rest of my life.</p>
      <p class="signature">Your future lover,<br>Arcel</p>
